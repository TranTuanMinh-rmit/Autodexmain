						<h1>My Profile</h1>
						<p class="info"><strong>Interest in IT</strong></p>
					</header>
					<p>My interest in IT began when I first saw my mom used a Lenovo ThinkPad and my dad was using a desktop. To my young mind, there was something just so alluring, so magical when looking into the screen of a laptop and desktop. The pictures, the videos and the games that were being displayed on the screen were so vibrant, so alive, they just drew me in. Time passes and my interest in technology in general begins to constantly at the fore front of my mind, how computers are made, how processors are made, how the machine language are written. That’s really how my interest in IT happened.<br />
					Choosing to study at RMIT is probably the most logical choice since the university not only offers top quality lectures and study materials, they also offers what most other university in Vietnam don’t and it’s practical experience.<br />
					My expectation when studying at RMIT is being able to learn what I need to pursuit my ideal job and make it into a career.</p>

							<p>My results from an online <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp">Myers-Briggs test</a>, a <a href=" http://www.testmycreativity.com/">Creativity test</a> and a <a href="https://personalitymax.com/learning-styles-test/">Learning Style test</a> are provided with the screenshots below.</p>

							<p>With the results of the tests above, I'm confident enough to say that I can be the voice of logic when working in a group to determine if a group choice is practical enough or if it's too ambitious. I will be the person who can help my team to organize our schedule, sorting out assignment for each person and will help the team to adapt and improvise when a problem occures.</p>

							</div>
							<p>This job requires me to have hands on experience in java 8 and above. Spring, Spring Boot platform for mobile application development. Finally HTML5, XML for website development.</p>
							<p>My own knowledge and studies have been focusing on Python, HTML. However, Java is still a computer language, one that can be learn, so I'll be studying it in my own time until RMIT universityhave classes that offers to teach Java. The same objective can be shared with the Spring application develop platform.</p>
