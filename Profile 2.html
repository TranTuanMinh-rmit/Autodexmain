						<h1>My Profile</h1>
						<p class="info"><strong>Interest in IT</strong></p>
					</header>
					<p>I have a very strong inspiration in this IT major, especially in game software development. This started when I was a kid, I watched a neighbor uncle play a computer shooting game, I was really curious about why with just such a small screen interacting. Be with the characters in the game. And from there I started tinkering with computers, about programs and games in the world.<br />
					The reason for choosing RMIT is a new experience when I can get acquainted with new technologies in foreign countries, and also make friends with knowledgeable people.</p>
