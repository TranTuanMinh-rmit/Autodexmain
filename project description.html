						<p class="info"><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
					</header>
					<p>Getting into the car would at the present is a daunting task, with so many manufacturers with as many car designs, models and no place to focus all of this information as clear as they possibly can. Autodex aims to eliminate such hurdle by doing what the Internet has been doing for years, gather information in one place for you so you don’t have to.</p>
					<header>
						<p class="info"><strong>Description</strong></p>
					</header>
					<p>Autodex will be mainly features as much known cars manufacturers as possible with at least five cars models for the last five years per manufacturer. Aside from car manufacturers’ name and their models, we will also be adding given specification of the manufacturers’ model and year of production. Furthermore, to avoid more confusion, we will also be adding a segment dedicated to explain what we think will be confusing or need explanations.</p>
					<p>This application however, will not states the price ranges, where to get the best deals or do anything to impede in the manufacturers’ sales. This will be strictly a free library of car models and their manufacturers.</p>

						<p class="info"><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
					</header>
					<p>If the project is successful, it will solve the hassle of going all over the internet to find information regarding cars models and their manufacturers. It will also help newcomers to have a better understanding of a car's specification and their meaning</p>
